You'll find those in appropriately named folders.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n1. An Arduino (two is ideal)\r\n2. A Raspberry Pi\r\n3. The git commandline tool, on both your Arduino IDE machine and your RPi\r\n4. RF 433MHz modules; a transmitter and receiver\r\n5. A Ninja Block and account\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Arduino\\_Sketches\r\n\r\nPlace the Sketches in your normal Arduino Sketches location.  Install any required libraries:\r\n\r\n1. Servo motor library (Should be included in the Arduino IDE)\r\n2. _Arduino_ [rc_switch](http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/) library\r\n\r\n### RPi\\_utils\r\n\r\nFrom your RPi, clone this archive:\r\n\r\n1. git clone git://github.com/justy/433Kit.git\r\n\r\n2. cd i433Kit/RPi\\_utils\r\n\r\n3. (As per the original rc_switch distribution) Follow the instructions to install the  [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/) library.\r\nAfter that you can compile the example programs by executing *make*. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### send \r\n```sudo ./send systemCode unitCode command```\r\n\r\nThis command is unaltered from the original rc\\_switch distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### codesend \r\n```sudo ./codesend decimalcode```\r\n\r\nThis command uses a single Ninja Blocks compatible decimal code.  Sniff out codes using the RF\\_Sniffer.ino Arduino sketch, included in this distribution.\r\n\r\nYou can use codesend to control the wireless servo on your Arduino.\r\n(The sketch is Servo\\_Receive\\_Demo.ino)\r\n\r\nI've implemented the most bare-bones of controls here.  Try:\r\n\r\n```sudo ./codesend 500000 # to move the servo up```\r\n\r\n```sudo ./codesend 500001 # to move the servo down```\r\n\r\n```sudo ./codesend 500002 # to move the servo left```\r\n\r\n```sudo ./codesend 500003 # to move the servo right```\r\n\r\n```sudo ./codesend 500004 # to move the servo home```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
